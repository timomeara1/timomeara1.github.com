Kori was very helpful in launching my blog on Github, the blog used the Jekyll gem.  I will try to write down the steps:

*	Create Repository
*	read up on Jekyll on Github, page includes link to many blogs using Jekyll gem
*	Install Jekyll
*	Found a style I wanted to copy from Tom Preston - Werner, very clean and minimalist
*	Did Git clone to copy Tom's blog : git clone git@github.com:mojombo/mojombo.github.com timomeara1.github.com (folder to copy to, same as repo on github for simplicity)
*	we had to add a couple more gems RedCloth and rdiscount because the template I was copying from required them
removed all references to Tom PW (thanks Tom!), his blog posts and added my own including links to twitter, posterous, github
*	added link to original blog styling source
*	BTW to make lists like the above in markdown you can use *, +, or - (followed by a space or tab)
